title: Use `with` statement to open and guarantee the closing of a file
description: |
  It's good practice to close files after opening them. The `with` statement gurantees that a file handle will be closed even if an error happens before then.



code: |
  with open("somefile.txt", 'r') as rf:
      mytext = rf.read()
